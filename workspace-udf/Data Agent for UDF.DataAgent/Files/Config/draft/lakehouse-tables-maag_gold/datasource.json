These instructions ensure optimal performance, data accuracy, and adherence to best practices when accessing the unified data foundation.\n\n## General Query Guidelines\n\n### 1. Schema and Table Naming Conventions\nAlways use fully qualified table names when writing queries:\n```sql\n-- Correct format\nSELECT * FROM shared.Customer\nSELECT * FROM finance.Account  \nSELECT * FROM salesfabric.Order\n\n-- Avoid unqualified names\nSELECT * FROM Customer  -- May cause ambiguity\n```\n\n### 2. Performance Optimization Principles\n- **Always query Gold tier first**: This data is optimized for analytics\n- **Use specific column selection**: Avoid `SELECT *` for large result sets\n- **Apply filters early**: Use WHERE clauses to limit data processing\n- **Leverage partitioning**: Filter by date columns when available\n\n### 3. Data Type Handling\n- **STRING fields**: Use single quotes for literal values\n- **DATE fields**: Use standard date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- **DECIMAL fields**: Handle NULL values appropriately in calculations\n- **BOOLEAN fields**: Use `true`/`false` (lowercase) for comparisons\n\n## Domain-Specific Query Instructions\n\n### Shared Domain Queries\n\n#### Customer Analysis Patterns\n```sql\n-- Customer segmentation by relationship type\nSELECT \n    CustomerRelationshipTypeId,\n    CustomerTypeId,\n    COUNT(*) as CustomerCount,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN IsActive = true THEN 1 END) as ActiveCount\nFROM shared.Customer\nGROUP BY CustomerRelationshipTypeId, CustomerTypeId\nORDER BY CustomerCount DESC;\n\n-- Customer demographics analysis\nSELECT \n    Gender,\n    CustomerRelationshipTypeId,\n    AVG(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), DateOfBirth) / 365) as AvgAge,\n    COUNT(*) as CustomerCount\nFROM shared.Customer\nWHERE IsActive = true \n  AND DateOfBirth IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY Gender, CustomerRelationshipTypeId;\n```\n\n#### Product Catalog Queries\n```sql\n-- Product pricing analysis by category\nSELECT \n    CategoryName,\n    COUNT(*) as ProductCount,\n    AVG(ListPrice) as AvgListPrice,\n    AVG(StandardCost) as AvgStandardCost,\n    AVG(ListPrice - StandardCost) as AvgMargin\nFROM shared.Product\nWHERE ListPrice > 0 AND StandardCost > 0\nGROUP BY CategoryName\nORDER BY AvgMargin DESC;\n\n-- Product variants analysis\nSELECT \n    CategoryName,\n    Color,\n    COUNT(*) as ProductCount,\n    AVG(ListPrice) as AvgPrice\nFROM shared.Product\nGROUP BY CategoryName, Color\nHAVING COUNT(*) >= 2\nORDER BY CategoryName, Color;\n```\n\n### Finance Domain Queries\n\n#### Account Balance Analysis\n```sql\n-- Account status summary\nSELECT \n    AccountType,\n    AccountStatus,\n    COUNT(*) as AccountCount,\n    SUM(Balance) as TotalBalance,\n    AVG(Balance) as AvgBalance\nFROM finance.Account\nGROUP BY AccountType, AccountStatus\nORDER BY AccountType, AccountStatus;\n\n-- Overdue accounts analysis\nSELECT \n    a.AccountNumber,\n    a.Balance,\n    a.CreatedDate,\n    c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId,\n    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), a.CreatedDate) as DaysOutstanding\nFROM finance.Account a\nJOIN shared.Customer c ON a.CustomerId = c.CustomerId\nWHERE a.AccountStatus = 'Overdue' \n  AND a.Balance > 0\nORDER BY a.Balance DESC;\n```\n\n### Sales Domain Queries\n\n#### Sales Performance Analysis\n```sql\n-- Monthly sales trends\nSELECT \n    YEAR(OrderDate) as SalesYear,\n    MONTH(OrderDate) as SalesMonth,\n    COUNT(*) as OrderCount,\n    SUM(OrderTotal) as TotalRevenue,\n    AVG(OrderTotal) as AvgOrderValue\nFROM salesfabric.Order\nWHERE OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)\nORDER BY SalesYear DESC, SalesMonth DESC;\n\n-- Payment method preferences\nSELECT \n    PaymentMethod,\n    COUNT(*) as OrderCount,\n    SUM(OrderTotal) as TotalRevenue,\n    AVG(OrderTotal) as AvgOrderValue\nFROM salesfabric.Order\nWHERE OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY PaymentMethod\nORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;\n```\n\n## Cross-Domain Analytics Patterns\n\n### Customer Value Analysis\n```sql\n-- Customer lifetime value by segment\nSELECT \n    c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId,\n    c.Gender,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderId) as OrderCount,\n    SUM(o.OrderTotal) as TotalRevenue,\n    AVG(o.OrderTotal) as AvgOrderValue,\n    SUM(o.OrderTotal) / COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderId) as RevenuePerOrder\nFROM shared.Customer c\nJOIN salesfabric.Order o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId\nWHERE c.IsActive = true \n  AND o.OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId, c.Gender\nORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;\n```\n\n### Product Performance with Customer Insights\n```sql\n-- Top products by customer segment\nSELECT \n    p.CategoryName,\n    p.Name,\n    c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId,\n    COUNT(*) as OrderFrequency,\n    SUM(ol.Quantity * ol.UnitPrice) as TotalRevenue\nFROM shared.Product p\nJOIN salesfabric.OrderLine ol ON p.ProductID = ol.ProductId\nJOIN salesfabric.Order o ON ol.OrderId = o.OrderId\nJOIN shared.Customer c ON o.CustomerId = c.CustomerId\nWHERE o.OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY p.CategoryName, p.Name, c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId\nHAVING TotalRevenue > 1000\nORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;\n```\n\n## Data Access Best Practices\n\n### 1. NULL Value Handling\nAlways consider NULL values in your queries:\n```sql\n-- Safe date calculations\nSELECT CustomerId,\n       CASE \n           WHEN DateOfBirth IS NOT NULL \n           THEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), DateOfBirth) / 365 \n           ELSE NULL \n       END as Age\nFROM shared.Customer;\n\n-- Safe aggregations\nSELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCustomers,\n       COUNT(SecondaryPhone) as CustomersWithSecondaryPhone,\n       COUNT(SecondaryEmail) as CustomersWithSecondaryEmail\nFROM shared.Customer;\n```\n\n### 2. Join Optimization\nUse appropriate join types and conditions:\n```sql\n-- Inner join for required relationships\nSELECT c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, a.Balance\nFROM shared.Customer c\nINNER JOIN finance.Account a ON c.CustomerId = a.CustomerId\nWHERE c.IsActive = true;\n\n-- Left join to include all records\nSELECT c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, COUNT(o.OrderId) as OrderCount\nFROM shared.Customer c\nLEFT JOIN salesfabric.Order o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId \n    AND o.OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY c.CustomerId, c.FirstName;\n```\n\n### 3. Date Range Filtering\nUse efficient date filtering for performance:\n```sql\n-- Efficient date range queries\nSELECT *\nFROM salesfabric.Order\nWHERE OrderDate >= '2024-01-01' \n  AND OrderDate < '2025-01-01'\n  AND OrderStatus = 'Completed';\n\n-- Year-over-year comparisons\nSELECT \n    YEAR(OrderDate) as Year,\n    SUM(OrderTotal) as YearlyRevenue,\n    LAG(SUM(OrderTotal)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(OrderDate)) as PreviousYearRevenue\nFROM salesfabric.Order\nWHERE OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)\nORDER BY Year;\n```\n\n## Common Query Patterns and Templates\n\n### 1. Customer Segmentation Template\n```sql\nSELECT \n    {segmentation_field},\n    COUNT(*) as CustomerCount,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN IsActive = true THEN 1 END) as ActiveCount,\n    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN IsActive = true THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as ActivePercentage\nFROM shared.Customer\nGROUP BY {segmentation_field}\nORDER BY CustomerCount DESC;\n```\n\n### 2. Time Series Analysis Template\n```sql\nSELECT \n    DATE_TRUNC('month', {date_field}) as Period,\n    COUNT(*) as RecordCount,\n    SUM({amount_field}) as TotalAmount,\n    AVG({amount_field}) as AvgAmount\nFROM {table_name}\nWHERE {date_field} >= '{start_date}'\n  AND {optional_filters}\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', {date_field})\nORDER BY Period;\n```\n\n### 3. Top N Analysis Template\n```sql\nSELECT \n    {dimension_field},\n    COUNT(*) as Frequency,\n    SUM({metric_field}) as Total,\n    ROUND(AVG({metric_field}), 2) as Average\nFROM {table_name}\nWHERE {filter_conditions}\nGROUP BY {dimension_field}\nORDER BY {ranking_metric} DESC\nLIMIT {n};\n```\n\n## Error Prevention Guidelines\n\n### 1. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- **Division by zero**: Always check denominators before division\n- **String case sensitivity**: Use UPPER() or LOWER() for consistent comparisons\n- **Date format assumptions**: Use explicit date formatting\n- **Aggregation without GROUP BY**: Ensure all non-aggregated columns are grouped\n\n### 2. Data Validation Checks\nBefore running complex analyses, validate data quality:\n```sql\n-- Check for data completeness\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) as TotalRecords,\n    COUNT(CustomerId) as NonNullCustomerIds,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerId) as UniqueCustomerIds\nFROM shared.Customer;\n\n-- Verify referential integrity\nSELECT \n    o.CustomerId,\n    COUNT(*) as OrderCount\nFROM salesfabric.Order o\nLEFT JOIN shared.Customer c ON o.CustomerId = c.CustomerId\nWHERE c.CustomerId IS NULL\nGROUP BY o.CustomerId;\n```\n\n### 3. Performance Monitoring\nMonitor query performance and adjust as needed:\n- Use EXPLAIN PLAN to understand query execution\n- Monitor query execution time for optimization opportunities\n- Consider adding filters or limiting result sets for exploratory queries\n- Use appropriate sampling for large dataset analysis\n\n## Business Context Guidelines\n\n### 1. Always Provide Business Meaning\nWhen writing queries, include comments explaining the business purpose:\n```sql\n-- Business Question: Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?\n-- This analysis helps prioritize marketing efforts and customer service resources\nSELECT \n    c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerId) as CustomerCount,\n    SUM(o.OrderTotal) as TotalRevenue,\n    SUM(o.OrderTotal) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerId) as RevenuePerCustomer\nFROM shared.Customer c\nJOIN salesfabric.Order o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId\nWHERE c.IsActive = true \n  AND o.OrderStatus = 'Completed'\nGROUP BY c.CustomerRelationshipTypeId\nORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;\n```\n\n### 2. Consider Data Currency and Accuracy\nAlways document the data freshness and any limitations:\n- Gold tier data is processed through automated pipelines\n- Order data is near real-time (within minutes of transaction)\n- Customer data is batch updated daily\n- Product catalog is updated weekly\n- Account balances are updated daily with end-of-day processing\n```\n",
